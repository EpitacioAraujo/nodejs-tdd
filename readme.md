# Node.js TDD Project

This project is a Node.js application built with a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. The goal is to provide a hands-on learning experience for developers interested in mastering TDD principles.

I use node test runer "node:test" to exec test files in pararel with tsx (TypeScript Execute) to execute .ts test files.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EpitacioAraujo/nodejs-tdd
   cd nodejs-tdd
   ```
